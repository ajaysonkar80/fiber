# Fiber Example

This example starts a [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) server.

## ✨ Features

- Fiber
- Go

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Connect to your Railway project `railway link`
- Start the development server `railway run go run main.go`

## 📝 Notes

The server started simply returns a `message: "Hello, Railway!"` payload in JSON. The server code is located in `main.go`.
